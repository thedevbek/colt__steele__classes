NEED TO TAKE A NODE CLASS THIS IS A BRUSH WITH IT TO USE EXPRESS!!!!!

You can require files from Node, but you must export them with exports.add = add; is an example

index.js is the main file for the directory shelter it can be exported in another directory if you require it.

You can have an index.js file in a directory and export them to the other files in the directory. Example is with shelter in files.

NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
