                        The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity (the
                        age at
                        which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13
                        years with
                        the longest lifespan of a dog being 22 years and a report of a dog living 29 years. The median
                        longevity
                        of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of
                        purebred
                        dogs when all breeds are averaged. For dogs in England, increased body weight has been found to
                        be
                        negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and
                        mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia,
                        blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical
                        conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds
                        and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested
                        dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to
                        parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms, which
                        is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.

                        Several human foods and household indigestible are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids,
                        causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide
                        poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol. The nicotine in tobacco can also
                        be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar
                        butts) or diarrhea. Some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or
                        death.

                        Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes,
                        dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.

                    <img src="imgs/heart_paw.png" alt="" class="d-none d-md-inline" width="150" height="100">

                    <p class="lead">
                        Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for
                        applying to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and
                        have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels
                        of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and
                        correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A
                        study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had
                        learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and
                        react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice
                        commands.

                        One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional
                        than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One limited study of 18
                        household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focussed on the "what" of a
                        task rather than the "where".

                        Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed
                        compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social
                        problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original
                        problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study revealed that after
                        undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version
                        of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.
